# Astroinformatics: Charting Exoplanetary Frontiers via KNN Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for detecting exoplanets using transit imaging technique among a given set of star systems. Exoplanet detection through transit imaging involves observing the periodic dimming of a star's light as an orbiting planet passes between the star and the observer, causing a transit signal.

## Features
The dataset used in this project contains various features extracted from transit imaging observations, including:
- Transit Depth: The amount of light blocked by the planet during transit.
- Transit Duration: The duration of the transit event.
- Orbital Period: The time taken for the planet to orbit its host star.
- Stellar Flux: The amount of light received from the star.
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): The ratio of signal strength to background noise.
- Transit Timing Variations (TTV): Deviations from the expected transit timing due to gravitational interactions.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from a combination of ground-based telescopes and space-based missions such as the Kepler Space Telescope and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). It consists of a curated collection of transit imaging observations of various star systems, along with corresponding labels indicating the presence or absence of exoplanets.
